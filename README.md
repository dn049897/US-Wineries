# US-Wineries

U.S. Wine exports 


As an American expat in Paris, I am pleasantly surprised when I see American products being sold in Parisian restaurants and bars.  Through my capstone project, I hope to gain greater insight on the volume of American wine exports and their global market share.   My research will also look at the economic impact U.S. Wineries have in the international and national economies.  The value of World Trade in wine is equivalent to USD$20 billion.  In 2011, the U.S. only made up ten percent of world’s wine production.  


Given, this industry’s economic importance, I will look closely at the amount of U.S. wine exports.  My data research will look at the number of U.S. Wines exports, destination markets, and the characteristics of these markets.  In regards, to the destination countries, I will look at the amount of their exports and their wine consumption. Then, I will compare how U.S. wineries are doing internationally compared to other internationally recognized wine exporting countries such as France.  In regards to the domestic impact,  I will evaluate the amount of jobs, wages, and overall economic impact of the wine and spirit industry.  My research will also consider the economic advantages of supporting the U.S. wine industry.


My clients for this project are the Wine Institute,Wine America, American Wine Society, and Wine Economics, and U.S. Congress.  I will use data from the Congressional Research Center, Wine Institute, Wine and Spirits Wholesales of America, Department of Commerce,  U.S. Census Data, as well as other sources.  


My project deliverable, will be both code and a written summary.  I hope that my clients use this information to advise U.S. wineries on international market opportunities.  I also hope my clients take this information into consideration when deciding in which countries to expand trade opportunities, through international trade shows and other international business exchanges, for U.S.Wineries.
